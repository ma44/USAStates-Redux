news.500.t:0 "The Fall of Kansas City"
news.500.d:0 "As the sun set in [KSK.GetNameDef], the armies of Kansas were encircling Kansas City. This wouldn’t be the first time the city was a victim of violence between the two states, but it would be the last time. Tomorrow, Kansan generals would give the order to bombard the remaining Missourians within the city, and destroy the remainder of the Missourian army. The war had been an immense toll for Missouri, whose citizens would have to bury thousands of their brothers, fathers, and friends. But now, as the sun sets on the bloody ground, so too will it set on old Missouri."
news.500.a:0 "It is Kansas City, why wouldn't the Kansans have it?"
news.500.b:0 "The cities are now reunited, onwards men!"
news.500.c:0 "We fought well, but we must retreat."
news.501.t:0 "The Fall of Las Vegas"
news.501.d:0 "Early today, the California News Service confirmed that forces from the [CAC.GetNameDef] have captured Las Vegas. After intense fighting along the Strip, and a desperate Nevadan counter-attack from Nellis AFB, the battle has concluded in a Californian victory. Civilians report that following California's discovery of a small contingency of Nevadan forces inside the Old Mormon Fort State Park, the Californian Artillery Corps was ordered to level the fort. Additionally, some sources claim that there is a tense standoff between the nervous Arizona armies and their New Californian neighbors along Boulder Dam. Only time will tell if this situation will lead to war."

news.502.t:0 "The Fall of Los Angeles"
news.502.d:0 "Against all odds, the forces from [KSK.GetNameDef] have captured the city of Los Angeles. Despite the city having a combined population higher than the entire State of Kansas, Kansan armies managed to fight their way through the dense Los Angeles streets and towards the heart of the City of Angels.\n Intense fighting erupted in downtown Los Angeles, and after discovering that a particularly accurate sniper was holed up within the Eastern Columbia Building, known by some as the “Jewel of the West”, Kansan High Command gave the order to level it.\n Unconfirmed reports have also surfaced that the Hollywood sign was severely damaged in a dive-bombing attack."
news.502.a:0 "An Unimaginable Success!"
news.502.b:0 "The heart of California, in the hands of such monsters..."

news.503.t:0 "The Fall of Sacramento"
news.503.d:0 "Press Corps observers covering the war in California have informed us that Sacramento has fallen to [KSK.GetNameDef]. Anticipating Sacramento's fall and wanting it to remain intact, Californian officials designated the capital an open city hours before enemy forces arrived. Though not the largest city in California, its fall will deal a significant blow to Californian morale.\n Additionally, due to its proximity to the much larger San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento will undoubtedly become a staging area for a campaign in Northern California and a possible assault on San Francisco."
news.503.a:0 "The first of our many victories to come!"
news.503.b:0 "Troubling, but our nation will recover!"
news.503.c:0 "They're lucky their Capital is so small."
news.504.t:0 "The Fall of San Francisco"
news.504.d:0 "Reports are now funneling in that [KSK.GetNameDef] has captured San Francisco. Californian forces, though initially holding Kansan forces back along bridge chokepoints, quickly became disorganized and retreated deeper into the city.\n In a desperate and arguably foolish decision, California ordered that inmates from Alcatraz be armed and organized into a penal battalion to repel the Kansan invaders. Some inmates were able to perform commendably, but others quickly used their new weapons to rebel and escape Californian custody.\n Thankfully, [KSK.GetNameDef] ordered that the Golden Gate Bridge be kept intact."
news.504.a:0 "San Francisco is ours! I believe a parade is in order!"
news.504.b:0 "At least the Golden Gate still stands..."
news.504.c:0 "They released WHAT?"
news.505.t:0 "The Fall of Denver"
news.505.d:0 "Denver, Capital of the [COC.GetNameDef] has fallen to advancing Kansan forces. Though they have managed to capture the city, [KSK.GetNameDef] suffered immensely from the fighting. Unaccustomed to mountain terrain and facing unseasonably cold temperatures, many Kansan soldiers perished during the march towards Denver. \n After reconsolidating their forces, the Kansan Army broke through the defensive lines along the narrow, winding mountain roads. However, when they arrived at downtown Denver, they found that the city had been completely evacuated while they were preoccupied. The capture of Denver marks a significant step on a long campaign to come."

news.505.b:0 "I'm glad we were able to evacuate so many."
news.505.c:0 "The Rockies are a cruel mistress."
news.506.t:0 "The Fall of Kansas City"
news.506.d:0 "Today, forces from the [MOM.GetNameDef] stormed Kansas City Kansas, capturing the city. In a stroke of genius, the Missourian Army funneled sapper units across the border under the cover of darkness, who then sabotaged Kansan defensive positions and equipment. After overwhelming the Kansan line and rushing into the city, Missourian forces promptly declared their victory. Reports have also surfaced that the Statue of John Brown has been defaced by Missourian soldiers. \n This is a significant victory for the Missourians, who have expressed interest in unifying Kansas City under one flag."

news.506.b:0 "We must counter-attack!"
news.506.c:0 "It seems that the situation in Kansas is looking grim."
news.507.t:0 "The Fall of Dallas"
news.507.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, Kansan soldiers have managed to capture Dallas. Motorized units have been spotted unloading columns of Kansan soldiers, as the remainder of the Texan resistance inside the city is quelled. Holdouts inside the Wilson building prompted engineers to clear it with flamethrowers. \n One of the largest cities in Texas, the fall of Dallas will no doubt deal a significant blow to [TXT.GetNameDef], who didn't expect such a successful attack from [KSK.GetNameDef]."

news.508.t:0 "The Fall of Houston"
news.508.d:0 "Late this afternoon, armies from [KSK.GetNameDef] captured Houston. Though many speculated that the city would be largely destroyed by Kansan armies, many landmarks, including the San Jacinto monument, were left standing in a display of mercy for [TXT.GetNameDef]. This is arguably one of Kansas' most significant victories, as the Sunflower State now for the first time has direct access to the Gulf of Mexico. A speech delivered by General Dwight D. Eisenhower promised that today marked "A new day for the [KSK.GetNameDef], and an end to Texan hedgemony.""

news.509.d:0 "War Correspondants have just revealed that Austin, Capital of [TXT.GetNameDef], has fallen to [KSK.GetNameDef]. This picture, taken hours before the Kansan assault on Austin, depicts a city blissfully unaware of the rapidly approaching conflict. A coordinated barrage of artillery and Close Air Support brought down the Texan State Capitol, which remained one of the few symbols of Texan strength. For the first time since the American Civil War, enemy troops have occupied Austin. Though Texas seemed poised to control much of the former United States, it seems now that the burden falls on Kansas."

news.509.c:0 "The Lone Star State has been trampled."
news.510.t:0 "The Fall Of Phoenix"
news.510.d:0 "Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, has fallen to advancing Californian forces. Once regarded by some as a fortress, the city of Phoenix was unable to hold out against an onslaught of combined air and ground bombardment. While the eastern half of the city was engaged in a pitched battle, Californian Special Forces scaled the South Mountain to surprise and encircle the remaining defenders. A spokesman from [CAC.GetNameDef] said of the victory, "This was a demonstration of our military might. Let it be a lesson to all those who would oppose the Bear.""

news.511.d:0 "Today forces from the New Californian Army occupied Topeka, the Capital of Kansas. The battle consisted of intense fighting up to the steps of the Kansas State Capitol building through the city's streets. Californian forces were taken by surprise as Kansan forces attempted to defend the steps of the Capitol building with several armored vehicles. After dispatching the tanks, Californian infantry stormed the now barricaded Capitol, eventually raising their flag atop its dome. Topeka remains one of the last steps for the [CAC.GetNameDef] on their march eastwards, and will certainly mean that Kansas City could be the next, potentially last, city to fall."

Meanwhile, California's Shock Troops stormed the Governor's Mansion in hopes of capturing the Governor. Unfortunately, though there was heavy fighting to defend the building, they had been extracted just hours before. After nearly a day of fighting, the remaining Texans surrendered, though many escaped into the surrounding suburbs. The loss of Austin represents a serious loss for the [TXT.GetNameDef], who are now scrambling to defend Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio from advancing Californian armies."
