Remaining stoic in the face of rapidly changing ideological beliefs, NCR President Frank Merriam delivered an address in Sacramento, vowing to stifle any communist elements within the government. Additionally, to "protect the ideals of democracy as enshrined by our forefathers", President Merriam has ordered large-scale military exercises along the borders of California. Several sources within the Californian Armed Forces has claimed that this will act as a deterrent to any radical nations wishing to spread their virulent ideologies in California. Their neighbors, however, have reacted with concern, and it seems that these exercises could lead to an arms race."
